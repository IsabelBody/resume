# Resume TODO List

## Code Cleanup
- [ ] Clean up commented-out code in experience.tex (NICE Lab, NLCIL sections)
- [ ] Review and clean up commented-out projects in projects.tex
- [ ] Clean up commented code in russell.cls (lines 7-12, 65, 154-158, etc.)

## Consistency Improvements
- [ ] Standardize date format - some entries use Current, others use Present (pick one consistently)

## Content Review
- [ ] Update skills section based on current job requirements (remove comment about updating)
- [ ] Review and update summary.tex - ensure it accurately reflects current role and goals
- [ ] Review education section formatting - ensure courses are properly listed and formatted

## Optional Decisions
- [ ] Decide whether to include/exclude Competitions section (currently commented in resume.tex)
- [ ] Check if profile.png should be added to resume (photo command exists but is commented)

## Verification
- [ ] Verify all links in projects/competitions sections are still valid and working
- [ ] Test compilation and verify PDF output looks correct after any changes
